	<h1>Welcome to WebViewToo {{ store.name }}!</h1>
	<p class="mb-3">
		WebViewToo provides a powerful set of tools for building HTML-based user
		interfaces with AutoHotkey. It leverages the Chromium Edge engine, known
		for its use in Microsoft Edge, because of its deep integration with the
		Microsoft Windows operating system and its wide availability across
		systems.
	</p>
	<p class="text-left">
		This example is designed to show how you can use third party frameworks
		like Vue to build advanced user interfaces, while still keeping all the
		code local. This script can be compiled and still function fine without
		the need to extract any files to a temporary directory.
	</p>
	<p class="text-left">
		As this example is more advanced, it assumes a stronger familiarity with
		the technology and may gloss over some parts more than other examples.
		If you're just getting started it may be helpful to work with some of
		the other example scripts first.
